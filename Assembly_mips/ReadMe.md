# Projects in Class CS465 (Computer Systems Architecture)

### Class Purpose
Computer subsystems and instruction set architectures. Single-cycle, multiple-cycle, and pipeline architectures. 
Memory hierarchy, cache, and virtual memory input-output processing.
### How to compile and run
Download Mars with this link:
http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm
Highly recomend using Mars to assemble and execute. This provides a gui for registers. 

### The code in this class demonstrates my ability to :
- Explain the organization of the classical von Neumann machine and its major functional components
- Compare performance of simple system configurations and understand the performance implications of architectural choices
- Show how instructions are represented at both the machine level and in the context of a symbolic assembler; be able to understand small MIPS programs and write MIPS assembly program segments
- Use different formats to represent numerical data and convert numerical data from one format to another
- Describe how an instruction is executed and the concept of datapaths and control
- Explain basic instruction level parallelism using pipelining and the major hazards that may occur
- Understand the effect of memory latency on running time; be able to describe the use of memory hierarchy to reduce the effective memory latency, in particular, the role of cache and virtual memory; be able to understand the principles of memory management
