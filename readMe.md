# Projects in Class CS 468: Secure Programming and Systems

### Class Purpose
Fundamental principles and techniques for implementing secure computer systems. 
Topics include security and cryptography basics, vulnerability analysis, secure software development, and distributed system security. 
Projects involve designing and programming basic security tools, secure programs, and distributed systems.
### How to compile and run
Run this code using commands:

``` 
gcc [programName].c -o programName

./programName
```

### The code in this class demonstrates my ability to :
- Describe the fundamental ethical responsibilities computer scientists have in securing and protecting computers.
- Explain basic mathematical principles underlying encryption algorithms.
- Explain basic mathematical principles underlying authentication algorithms.
- Demonstrate an understanding of cryptographic protocols.
- Demonstrate an understanding of secure programming via attack models and vulnerability analysis.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of secure software design.
- Describe how Operating Systems implement security for critical system components.
- Explain network and transport level security protocols with IPSec.
- Illustrate fundamental understanding of security principles by programming projects in cryptography, secure programming and communications.and virtual memory; be able to understand the principles of memory management

### The projects:
- An Advanced Encryption Standard implementation in C, both encyption and decryption
-  A Data Encryption Standard implementation in C, both encyption and decryption
-  Secure remote client and server with key exchange.
