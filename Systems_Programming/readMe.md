# Projects in Class CS 367: Computer Systems and Programming

### Class Purpose
Introduces students to computer systems from a programmer's perspective. Topics include data representation, assembly and machine-level representation of 
high-level language programs, the memory hierarchy, linking, exceptions, interrupts, processes and signals, virtual memory, and system-level I/O. 
### How to compile and run
Run this code using commands:

``` 
gcc [programName].c -o programName

./programName
```

### The code in this class covers:
- Data and Number Representation
- Machine Level Representation of Data and Programs
- Processes
- Exceptional Control Flow
- Linking and Loading
- CPU Architecture
- Virtual Memory and Caching
- Dynamic Memory Allocation

### The projects:
- shell.c is a shell program from scratch writen in c. handles a variety of commands
- scheduler.c is a simulated computer job scheduler
- fp_functs.c implements floating point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
